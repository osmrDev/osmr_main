                                  Preface

Program architecture is relies on self contained modules or pages.

All files are named after their primary function. (ie. startScreen.js contains the startScreen() function).

Rendering is done using PIXI.js v7

                                File Structure

Docs           - documentation for program
Fonts          - fonts
Lib            - 3rd party libraries
Main           - code that is executed on initialization
Modules        - self contain pages
Modules_Common - helper functions that are used by multiple modules
resource       - Asset dump
resource_conv  - Converted assets (ie. decrypted and reencoded audio files)

                                   Modules

Think of a module as a 'page' on a website.

Each page should have an ingress function same as the page name.
Example: vnScreen page should have an ingress function called vnScreen()
Arguments to ingress function is ok.

Each page should be self contained.
This means no calling functions from other pages except for the ingress function
Calling functions from helper functions is ok (helper functions in Moudles_Common)

The ingress function does typically does 6 things:
1. Clear the screen
2. Create layers to draw on ( PIXI.Container() )
3. Call functions (usually to draw on the layer and do other game stuff)
4. Add the layer to the stage (GV_app.stage aka the renderer)
5. Add aspect ratio crop box
6. restart the game ticker (calling the clear screen helper stops the ticker)

Your page can be started by any other page. (using the your page's ingress function)
Your page can call any other page. (using the other page's ingress function)

                                   Program flow

On startup, index.html is loaded which will load all JS files. Any new JS files must be included in index.html

Code in the 'Main' folder is executed this will setup the environment (fonts, renderer, params, etc).

Once main is finished it opens the start screen page.

The start screen page renders a basic background and click listener.
Once clicked it redirects to the home screen.

From there home screen will have buttons that redirect to other pages which may redirect to other pages

                                Data management

assetManafest.js, storyManafest.js, contains links to the resources folder.

Pages should not use 'hard links' but instead use the links provided in the manafest folder.

settings.js contains global variables for settings and parameters.
Things like voulme, fade in/out timing, text color, character size, etc. should go in here

                                 Game saves

Game saves will use local storage api. (not yet implemented)
